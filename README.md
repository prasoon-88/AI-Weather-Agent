🌟 Basic CLI AI Weather Agent

This project is a Command-Line Interface (CLI) AI Agent that provides real-time weather information based on the location specified in the user's prompt. It leverages the Gemini AI API to enhance intelligent workflows and demonstrates the START-PLAN-ACTION-OBSERVATION-OUTPUT framework for building AI agents.
📋 Features

    🌦️ Fetches real-time weather information for any location.
    🧠 Implements the AI agent workflow:
        START: Understands the goal.
        PLAN: Decides how to gather weather data.
        ACTION: Fetches data from APIs.
        OBSERVATION: Processes the response.
        OUTPUT: Returns accurate weather information to the user.
    🔗 Gemini AI API integration for intelligent behavior.
    💻 Built entirely in Node.js, making it lightweight and efficient.

🚀 Installation

    Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/cli-ai-weather-agent.git
cd cli-ai-weather-agent

Install dependencies:

npm install

Set up environment variables:

    Create a .env file in the root directory.
    Add your Gemini AI API key and Weather API key:

    GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
    WEATHER_API_KEY=your_weather_api_key

Run the project:

    node index.js

🌟 Usage

    Launch the application:

node index.js

Enter a location in the prompt to get the current weather:

    > What's the weather in New York?

    The agent will provide real-time weather data, including temperature, humidity, and more.
